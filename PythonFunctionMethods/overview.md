Welcome to our tutorial on Python functions. In this series we are doing a deep dive into the various methods you can use with the built in Python functions. This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Python. 

# Why Dig Deeper into built in Python Functions
The built in functions that Python offers are tools, and like any tool, the better you understand it, the better you can use it. Our goal in this tutorial is to gain a better understanding of how these tools work and how they can make our lives easier. More importantly, instead of reinventing the wheel when writing your code, you can just use the tools the Python already gives us to play with.
