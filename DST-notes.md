Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science and understanding them is important for several reasons:

1. **Dynamic Data Structure**: Linked lists are dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory². This flexibility makes them a powerful tool for handling data whose size might change during the execution of a program.

2. **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**: Linked lists provide efficient insertion and deletion operations¹⁴. This makes them particularly useful in scenarios where you need to frequently add or remove elements.

3. **Implementation of Other Data Structures**: Linked lists can be used to implement other abstract data types such as stacks and queues⁴. Understanding linked lists, therefore, can help you understand these other data structures as well.

4. **Versatility**: Linked lists are versatile and can handle data in individual objects called nodes. These nodes hold both the data and a reference to the next node in the list⁴.

5. **Types of Linked Lists**: There are various types of linked lists such as singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list, etc., each with its own advantages and use-cases².

In Python, the `deque` (double-ended queue) from the `collections` module is an example of a doubly-linked list where you can append and pop elements from both ends of the queue with approximately the same O(1) performance.

By understanding linked lists, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how data is stored, manipulated, and accessed in computer memory. This knowledge is crucial when it comes to designing, optimizing, and scaling programs².
