"""
The First Unique Character in a String problem is a classic problem in computer science. Given a string, the goal is to find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1Â¹.

Here's an example of how you can solve this problem using the `deque` data structure in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def first_unique_char(s):
    dq = deque()
    for char in s:
        if char not in dq:
            dq.append(char)
        else:
            dq.remove(char)
    if len(dq) > 0:
        return s.index(dq[0])
    else:
        return -1

# Example:
s = "leetcode"
print(first_unique_char(s)) # Output: 0
```

In this example, we use a `deque` to keep track of the characters in the input string `s`. We iterate over the input string from left to right. For each character `char`, we check if it is already in the `deque`. If it is not, we append it to the right of the `deque`. If it is, we remove it from the `deque`.

After we finish iterating over the input string, we check if the `deque` is not empty. If it is not empty, we return the index of the first element in the `deque` (`dq[0]`) in the input string `s`. If it is empty, we return -1.

I hope this example helps you understand how to solve the First Unique Character in a String problem using the `deque` data structure in Python! ðŸ˜Š
