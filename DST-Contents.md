# Python Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to our Python Data Structures tutorial. In this tutorial, we are going to teach some data structures in Python. This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Python. 

* [Stacks](DST-stacks.md)
* [Sets](DST-sets.md)
* [Trees](DST-trees.md)

In these tutorials, our goal is to do more than to simply teach you the syntax of the various data structures we talk about; we want to empower you to be able to actually solve problems with what you learn. 

Each module will contain descriptions, examples, and instructions on how to use it. Additionally, each module will contain problems to help you dive deeper. We will walk you through one problem entirely and, the next problem, we will challenge you to solve on your own, but will provide a solution which you can use to check your answer, and the last problem, we will just give you the problem and it will be up to you to figure out the solution. We will provide the results you should get if you have solved the third problem correctly. The reason we structure it this way is because, if you are truly going to learn to solve problems, then, sometimes, you need to take a dive into a problem where you simply are not given an answer.
