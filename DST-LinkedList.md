For our first challenge, our goal is to take a string of unknown length, collect all unique characters from that string, and return the first character from that string that is unique. For example, in the string "aabbcdeeff", we would want to collect the "c" and the "d" then return the "c" when complete.

For our second challenge, our goal is to find the longest continuous sequence of unique characters that exists within a string. For example, if we were provided the string "abcbbacdf". We would first find the substring "abc" from the start of the string with a length of 3, and then find the string "bacdf" from the find end of the string with a length of 5, and from there return 5 from the function.

Try figuring this out on your own and then compare your solution to ours.

- **Constrained Subsequence Sum**: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied. A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original orderÂ¹.
