- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating charactersÂ¹.

- **Constrained Subsequence Sum**: Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied. A subsequence of an array is obtained by deleting some number of elements (can be zero) from the array, leaving the remaining elements in their original orderÂ¹.

- **First Unique Character in a String**: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1Â¹.

These problems can be challenging and require the use of algorithms to solve. You can find more challenging programming problems on websites such as [Python Principles](^3^), [Edabit](^4^), and [DataCamp](^5^). These websites offer a variety of challenges to help you develop your skills in Python. I hope this helps! ðŸ˜Š
