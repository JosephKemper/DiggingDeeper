The `deque` data structure in Python is a powerful tool for solving a variety of challenging programming problems. Here are some examples of problems that can be solved using the `deque` data structure:

- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elementsÂ¹.

This problem can be challenging and requires the use of algorithms to solve. You can find more challenging programming problems on websites such as [Python Principles](^3^), [Edabit](^4^), and [DataCamp](^5^). These websites offer a variety of challenges to help you develop your skills in Python. I hope this helps! ðŸ˜Š


- **Palindromic Substrings**: Given a string, count the number of palindromic substrings in it. A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same forwards and backwardsÂ¹.
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating charactersÂ¹.

These problems can be challenging and require the use of algorithms to solve. You can find more challenging programming problems on websites such as [Python Principles](^3^), [Edabit](^4^), and [DataCamp](^5^). These websites offer a variety of challenges to help you develop your skills in Python. I hope this helps! ðŸ˜Š
