For our first challenge, our goal is to take a string of unknown length, collect all unique characters from that string, and return the first character from that string that is unique. For example, in the string "aabbcdeeff", we would want to collect the "c" and the "d" then return the "c" when complete.

For our second challenge, our goal is to find the longest continuous sequence of unique characters that exists within a string. For example, if we were provided the string "abcbbacdf". We would first find the substring "abc" from the start of the string with a length of 3, and then find the string "bacdf" from the find end of the string with a length of 5, and from there return 5 from the function.

Try figuring this out on your own and then compare your solution to ours.

Another problem that uses the Python deque data structure and could be an appropriate final challenge for your lesson on linked lists is the “Palindrome Checker” problem. This problem involves checking whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, capitalization, and spacing. A deque can be used to solve this problem efficiently by adding the characters of the string to the deque and then comparing the characters at the front and rear of the deque until they are different or until the deque is empty. This problem is a practical application of the deque data structure and could be a good fit for your blog post on linked lists. Is there anything else you would like to know?
