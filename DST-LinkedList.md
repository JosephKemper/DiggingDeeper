For our first challenge, our goal is to take a string of unknown length, collect all unique characters from that string, and return the first character from that string that is unique. For example, in the string "aabbcdeeff", we would want to collect the "c" and the "d" then return the "c" when complete.

For our second challenge, our goal is to find the longest continuous sequence of unique characters that exists within a string. For example, if we were provided the string "abcbbacdf". We would first find the substring "abc" from the start of the string with a length of 3, and then find the string "bacdf" from the find end of the string with a length of 5, and from there return 5 from the function.

Try figuring this out on your own and then compare your solution to ours.

For our third challenge, our goal is to take in an unknown string, and check if it is a palindrome or not. Your program should be able to handle cases where the central letter in the palindrome is a single letter or comes in a pair. We do not need to worry about phrases, or case, but if you want to go above and beyond, please do so. Either way, when you are finished, join in the discussion below and discuss your solution with everyone else.
